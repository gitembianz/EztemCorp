The information we collect may include your name and contact details (including your telephone number, address and email address) or information about your activities (details of purchases, contact with us) or preferences. If you make a purchase from us, we will use financial information in order to process your payment.

This information might include your internet protocol address, the browser being used to connect to our site, the device (e.g. its operating system) and the connection type (e.g. the Internet service provider used).
